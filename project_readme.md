# This project is a Face Recognition system implemented in Python using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Here's a detailed breakdown of the project

1. Purpose:
The main goal of this project is to recognize faces in real-time using a webcam. It uses a simple machine learning approach (KNN) to classify faces based on pre-trained data.

2. Key Components:

   a. Data Preparation:
   - The system loads pre-processed face data from .npy files stored in a 'data' directory.
   - Each .npy file represents a person's face data.
   - The system creates a mapping between class IDs and names based on the file names.

   b. KNN Algorithm:
   - A custom implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is used for classification.
   - It includes functions for calculating Euclidean distance and performing KNN classification.

   c. Face Detection:
   - OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier is used for detecting faces in the video stream.

   d. Real-time Recognition:
   - The system captures video from the webcam and processes it frame by frame.
   - For each detected face, it extracts the face region, resizes it, and uses KNN to predict the person's identity.

3. Workflow:

   a. Data Loading:
   - The system loads pre-processed face data and labels from .npy files.
   - It creates a training set by combining face data and corresponding labels.

   b. Real-time Processing:
   - The webcam feed is continuously captured and processed.
   - Faces are detected in each frame using the Haar Cascade classifier.

   c. Face Recognition:
   - For each detected face, the system:
     - Extracts the face region
     - Resizes it to 100x100 pixels
     - Flattens the image data
     - Uses KNN to classify the face
     - Maps the predicted class ID to a name

   d. Display:
   - The system draws bounding boxes around detected faces.
   - It displays the predicted name above each face.

4. Key Functions:

   - `distance(v1, v2)`: Calculates Euclidean distance between two vectors.
   - `knn(train, test, k=5)`: Implements the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

5. Technologies Used:
   - OpenCV (cv2): For video capture and image processing
   - NumPy: For efficient array operations
   - Python's os module: For file and directory operations

6. User Interaction:
   - The system runs continuously, processing and displaying video frames.
   - The user can exit the program by pressing 'q'.

This project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning in computer vision, combining real-time video processing with a simple yet effective classification algorithm. It's a good example of how basic machine learning concepts can be applied to create a functional face recognition system.
