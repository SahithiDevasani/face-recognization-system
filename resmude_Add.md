## description

Here's a concise project description for your B.Tech project:

---

**Project Title:** Real-Time Face Detection and Recognition System

**Project Overview:**

This project involves developing a real-time face detection and recognition system using Python and OpenCV. The system consists of two primary components:

1. **Face Data Collection:** A script (`face_data_collect.py`) captures images from a webcam, detects faces using Haar cascades, and stores the face data in numpy arrays. This data serves as the training set for the recognition system.

2. **Face Recognition:** Another script (`face_recognition.py`) loads the pre-processed face data, detects faces in real-time video streams, and uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify and recognize individuals. The recognized faces are displayed with bounding boxes and names.

**Key Features:**

- **Real-time Face Detection:** Uses OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier for efficient face detection.
- **KNN-Based Recognition:** Implements a custom KNN algorithm for face classification.
- **Data Management:** Stores and loads face data from numpy files for training and testing purposes.

**Technologies Used:**

- **OpenCV (cv2):** For video capture and image processing.
- **NumPy:** For efficient array operations.
- **Python:** As the primary programming language.

**Applications:**

- **Security Systems:** Can be integrated into surveillance systems for identity verification.
- **Access Control:** Useful for secure entry systems based on facial recognition.
- **Social Media:** Can be used for tagging and identifying individuals in photos.

This project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning and computer vision in real-time face recognition, showcasing how basic concepts can be applied to create functional systems.
